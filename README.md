# üèõÔ∏è Preserving Heritage: Enhancing Tourism with AI  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project combines **computer vision** and **recommendation systems** to solve real-world challenges in tourism and cultural heritage.  

- **Part 1:** Classify images of historical structures using **CNNs with transfer learning** to monitor heritage sites and assist preservation.  
- **Part 2:** Build a **tourism recommendation engine** that personalizes attraction suggestions for users based on demographics, preferences, and ratings.

## üß† Part 1: Image Classification of Historical Structures  

### Objective  
Develop a **TensorFlow/Keras CNN model** to categorize historical structures from images.  

### Workflow  
- **Data Preparation:** Loaded training & test datasets (`Structures_dataset.zip`, `dataset_test`).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized samples with **OpenCV**.  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN backbones.  
  - Added dense layers + dropout for regularization.  
  - Hyperparameter tuning (optimizer, loss function, callbacks).  
- **Training:**  
  - With and without data augmentation.  
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.  
- **Evaluation:** Monitored validation accuracy; visualized learning curves.  

### Tech Stack  
`TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

## üó∫Ô∏è Part 2: Tourism Recommendation Engine  

### Objective  
Develop a **collaborative filtering recommender system** using user ratings and attraction metadata.  

### Workflow  
- **Datasets:**  
  - `user.csv` ‚Üí user demographics  
  - `tourism_with_id.csv` ‚Üí attraction details (category, city, price, rating)  
  - `tourism_rating.csv` ‚Üí user ratings  
- **EDA:**  
  - Cleaned and merged datasets.  
  - Analyzed demographics, top-rated attractions, and category insights.  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Built collaborative filtering model to recommend places.  
  - Generated recommendations based on user history and similar tourists.  

### Tech Stack  
`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
