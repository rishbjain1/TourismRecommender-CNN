# TourismRecommender-CNN


AI-powered project that merges **deep learning** and **recommender systems** to transform tourism experiences.  

This capstone explores two complementary challenges:  
1. **Heritage Classification with CNNs** — using computer vision to classify centuries-old historical structures.  
2. **Tourism Recommendation Engine** — personalizing tourist experiences through data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Part 1: Heritage Image Classification**  
- Utilized **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **transfer learning**.  
- Classified images of historical structures into categories.  
- Helps agencies monitor heritage sites and prioritize maintenance.  

**Part 2: Recommender System**  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on tourist demographics and attractions.  
- Built a **collaborative filtering recommendation model** using ratings data.  
- Suggests destinations tailored to each tourist’s interests and preferences.
